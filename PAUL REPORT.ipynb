The plan of our house can be found below. The objective of this study case is the nalysis of a cubic building with 5 identical walls & a transparent wall (glass window), air infiltration, and HVAC system controlling the indoor air temperature.\n\n# Design model\n\nThe room that we will study is presented in the figure below. Two rooms are separated by a small wall without insulation. The total area of the model is about 9 meters square and the ceiling is 3 meters high. The rooms have each 3 exterior walls and one interior wall. We will consider the house as insulated from the outside .\nThe interior walls are made of concrete. The room also has a 1 m² window, a 2 m² door and a HVAC device.\n\n\n\n <center><img src=\"https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/cghiaus-dm4bem-v9wqwu31/files/Adobe%20Scan%2024%20avr.%202023%20(1)%20(1).pdf?_xsrf=2%7C8d3810e3%7C68e4a5cde0ead2325dbafcff04581392%7C1682336278\"/></center>\n\n> Figure 1.
