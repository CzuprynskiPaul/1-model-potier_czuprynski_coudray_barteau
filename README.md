This repository contains the report for the project, done on a Jupyter notebook. The code used for the project is also included.


## Introduction






## Plan of a two-zone building






## Formulate the hypothesis for boundary conditions


## Boundary Conditions

Uniform surface temperature on every wall;
  

  Unidirectionnal heat transfer inside every wall (length and height >> thickness);

  
  All heat transfers are considered linear;

  Temperature of the exterior air = 25 °C;

  Desired value for the temperature of the interior air = 18 °C;

  Ambient temperature of the adjacent rooms = 20 °C

Other properties

  Exterior air volume flow = 4 m3/s;
  Solar radiation of each wall depends on its orientation and tilt;
  Solar radiation constant over a single wall




## Chose the types of windows, doors, and walls






## Thermal circuit
