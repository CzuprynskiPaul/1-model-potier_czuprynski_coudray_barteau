Introduction






Plan of a two-zone building






Formulate the hypothesis for boundary conditions


Boundary Conditions

  Uniform surface temperature on every wall;

  Unidirectionnal heat transfer inside every wall (length and height >> thickness);

  All heat transfers are considered linear;

  Temperature of the exterior air = 25 °C;

  Desired value for the temperature of the interior air = 18 °C;

  Ambient temperature of the adjacent rooms = 20 °C

Other properties

  Exterior air volume flow = 4 m3/s;
  Solar radiation of each wall depends on its orientation and tilt;
  Solar radiation constant over a single wall




Chose the types of windows, doors, and walls






Thermal circuit
